Use `<DirectoryListing />` to display the directory of a specific folder.

```mdx live
import { DirectoryListing } from "~/components";

{/*
    `descriptions` is an optional flag which requires pages
    to have a `description` frontmatter property
*/}
<DirectoryListing
    folder="workers/wrangler"
    descriptions
/>
```
