title: Example
---

Use the `<Example>` component to add a box around some content. This can be useful when trying to demonstrate something that could otherwise be mistaken as the explanation of the same thing.

```mdx live
import { Example } from "~/components"

<Example>
    Hello, world!
</Example>

{/*
    `title` is an optional string which customizes the title of your example card
*/}

<Example title="Hello world">
    Hello, world!
</Example>
```
